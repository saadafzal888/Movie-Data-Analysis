# Movie Data Analysis with Python (EDA)

This project dives deep into a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of over 4,800 movies using two datasets (`movies.csv` and `credits.csv`). By merging, cleaning, and visualizing this data, the project uncovers trends in movie production, popularity, revenue, genres, languages, and more from 1997 to 2016.

## Dataset Overview

- **movies.csv** â€” includes metadata like budget, genres, homepage, keywords, language, and popularity.
- **credits.csv** â€” contains cast and crew information for each movie.

Merged on: `id` (from movies) and `movie_id` (from credits)

## Key Questions Explored

- Which year had the highest number of movie releases?
- What is the relationship between movie budgets and revenues?
- Which genres dominate the industry?
- What languages are most common in global cinema?
- What are the patterns in average movie ratings?
